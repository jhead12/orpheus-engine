* Fix: WindowAutoScroll component fixes
  - Fixed a TypeScript error where the `thresholds` prop could be a number or an array of objects, but the code assumed it was always an array.
  - Improved code readability by replacing nested ternary operators with `if/else if/else` statements.
  - Fixed a bug where the component would scroll in the wrong direction when the scroll amount was negative.
