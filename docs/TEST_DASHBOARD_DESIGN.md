# Integrated Test Dashboard Design

## Overview

The Integrated Test Dashboard provides a unified interface for monitoring and managing all testing activities in the Orpheus Engine project. It brings together unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and AI-powered test workflows into a cohesive system.

## Architecture

![Test Dashboard Architecture](../assets/screenshots/test-dashboard-architecture.png)

### Components

1. **Test Runner Hub**
   - Coordinates test execution across different frameworks
   - Manages test scheduling and prioritization
   - Handles test parallelization

2. **Results Aggregator**
   - Collects results from different test frameworks
   - Normalizes data into a consistent format
   - Generates consolidated reports

3. **Visualization Engine**
   - Real-time test status displays
   - Interactive coverage reports
   - Performance trend analysis

4. **AI Integration Layer**
   - Test case generation interface
   - Result analysis and pattern recognition
   - Workflow recommendation system

## User Interface

### Main Dashboard
- Overview of all test types and their status
- Key metrics (pass rate, coverage, run time)
- Recent activity and test trends

### Test Explorer
- Hierarchical view of all test suites
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Run/debug individual tests

### Coverage Analyzer
- Interactive code coverage visualization
- Hotspots for untested code
- Historical coverage trends

### Performance Monitor
- Test execution time trends
- Component-level performance metrics
- Comparison between versions

### AI Insights Panel
- Generated test recommendations
- Pattern detection in failures
- Suggested workflow improvements

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React for UI components
- D3.js for data visualization
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Backend
- Node.js API server
- Redis for real-time event handling
- MongoDB for test result storage

### Testing Frameworks Integration
- Vitest adapter
- Playwright connector
- Jest integration

### AI Components
- TensorFlow.js for in-browser analysis
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- LangChain for AI agent orchestration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Dashboard
- Basic test runner integration
- Simple results visualization
- Manual test execution

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics
- Comprehensive test history
- Advanced filtering and reporting
- Performance tracking

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- Test case generation
- Result pattern analysis
- Workflow optimization suggestions

## API Design

### Test Runner API
```typescript
interface TestRunnerConfig {
  framework: 'vitest' | 'playwright' | 'jest';
  testFiles: string[];
  environment: TestEnvironment;
  timeout?: number;
}

interface TestResult {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'passed' | 'failed' | 'skipped' | 'running';
  duration: number;
  coverage?: CoverageData;
  errors?: ErrorData[];
  timestamp: number;
}

async function runTests(config: TestRunnerConfig): Promise<TestRunSummary>;
```

### Results API
```typescript
interface TestRunSummary {
  runId: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  totalTests: number;
  passed: number;
  failed: number;
  skipped: number;
  duration: number;
  coverage: CoverageSummary;
}

async function getTestResults(runId: string): Promise<TestResult[]>;
async function getTestHistory(filters: TestHistoryFilters): Promise<TestRunSummary[]>;
```

### AI Integration API
```typescript
interface TestRecommendation {
  type: 'new-test' | 'fix-suggestion' | 'coverage-improvement';
  description: string;
  confidence: number;
  targetFiles: string[];
  suggestedImplementation?: string;
}

async function getTestRecommendations(): Promise<TestRecommendation[]>;
async function generateTestCases(filePath: string): Promise<TestCase[]>;
```

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to see all test results in one place so I can quickly assess the health of my codebase.

2. As a QA engineer, I want to run specific test suites and analyze their results to verify features.

3. As a team lead, I want to monitor test coverage trends to ensure quality standards are maintained.

4. As a product owner, I want to see how new features affect overall system stability through test metrics.

5. As a developer, I want AI-generated suggestions for improving test coverage and fixing failing tests.

## Next Steps

1. Implement core test runner integration with Vitest
2. Create basic results visualization dashboard
3. Establish WebSocket-based real-time updates
4. Integrate with GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
