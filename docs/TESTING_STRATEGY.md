- E2E test results (Playwright)
- Visual regression test results
- Coverage reports
- Performance metrics

### 2. Test Automation Pipeline

Establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that:
- Runs tests on every commit
- Enforces code quality standards
- Provides immediate feedback to developers
- Integrates with GitHub workflows
- Generates detailed reports

### 3. AI-Ready Test Infrastructure

Prepare the testing infrastructure for AI integration:
- Test data generation using AI models
- Automated test case creation
- Test result analysis and pattern recognition
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Workflow recommendations

### 4. Cross-Environment Testing

Ensure the application works consistently across:
- Desktop Electron environment
- Browser environment
- Different operating systems
- Various audio configurations
- Different server configurations (using server-agnostic setup)

## Metrics & Success Criteria

- **Coverage**: Achieve >80% code coverage across the codebase
- **Reliability**: Reduce flaky tests to <5% of test suite
- **Performance**: Ensure test suite completes in <10 minutes
- **Integration**: Successfully integrate 3+ AI-powered testing workflows
- **Automation**: Achieve >90% automated test coverage for critical paths

## Next Steps

1. Implement the unified test dashboard
2. Enhance test coverage for core components
3. Set up the test data infrastructure
4. Create the first AI integration points
5. Establish performance benchmarking

### 3. Unified Test Runner

The project uses a unified test runner that can execute tests from both the root project and OEW-main submodule. To ensure reliable test execution:

- Run tests using `pnpm run test:ui:unified` from the root directory
- Tests can also be run directly from OEW-main using `pnpm test:ui`

#### Critical Dependencies

To avoid false negatives and ensure consistent test behavior:

- React and ReactDOM versions must match between root and OEW-main projects
- Testing libraries (@testing-library/react, @testing-library/dom, etc.) should be aligned
- Vitest configuration and setup files are shared between root and submodule

#### Dependency Management Best Practices

1. When updating React or testing-related dependencies:
   - Update both root and OEW-main package.json files
   - Use exact versions (e.g., "18.2.0" instead of "^18.2.0")
   - Run `pnpm install` in both locations after updates

2. Key dependencies to keep in sync:
   - react
   - react-dom
   - @testing-library/react
   - @testing-library/dom
   - @testing-library/user-event
   - @vitejs/plugin-react
   - vitest

3. Verify test environment:
   - React hooks should use a single React instance
   - Test setup files should load in the correct order
   - Module resolution should be consistent between root and submodule
