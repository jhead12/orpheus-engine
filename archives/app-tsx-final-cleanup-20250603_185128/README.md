# App.tsx Consolidation Summary

## Current State (June 3, 2025)

### Active App.tsx
- **Main Entry Point**: `/Volumes/PRO-BLADE/Github/orpheus-engine/workstation/frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - This is the primary App.tsx used by the build system
  - Referenced in `package.json` main entry point via `src/index.tsx`
  - Contains consolidated functionality with DAW components and context providers

### Archived App.tsx Files (in this backup)
- **OEW-main-App.tsx**: Previously at `workstation/frontend/OEW-main/src/App.tsx`
  - Reference implementation with advanced features
  - Should be archived as it's not the main entry point
  
- **legacy-electron-App.tsx**: Previously at `workstation/electron/legacy/src/App.tsx`
  - Legacy Electron-specific implementation
  - Can be archived as functionality has been consolidated

### Previous Backups
- `archives/app-tsx-backup-20250603_164034/`
- `archives/app-tsx-backup-20250603_164127/`

### Recommendation
1. Keep `/Volumes/PRO-BLADE/Github/orpheus-engine/workstation/frontend/src/App.tsx` as the main implementation
2. Archive or remove the OEW-main and legacy versions since they're no longer active entry points
3. The consolidation appears to have been completed successfully

### Timeline
- Initial consolidation: June 3, 2025 ~16:40
- Final cleanup: June 3, 2025 18:51
