# App.tsx Conflicts Archive - 2025-06-04

This archive contains the conflicting App.tsx files that were causing TypeScript compilation errors in the Orpheus Engine Workstation project.

## Files Archived:

1. **electron-legacy-App.tsx** - Originally from `workstation/electron/legacy/src/App.tsx`
   - Simple Electron-focused App component
   - Used MemoryRouter for routing
   - Minimal DAW features

2. **oew-main-App.tsx.backup** - Originally from `workstation/frontend/OEW-main/src/App.tsx.backup`
   - More advanced DAW features
   - Better component organization
   - Enhanced Electron integration

3. **main-App.tsx** - Reference copy of the current main App.tsx from `workstation/frontend/src/App.tsx`
   - The consolidated version that combines features from all versions
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
   - Includes export plugin functionality

## Reason for Archival:

These files were causing TypeScript compilation conflicts due to:
- Multiple App.tsx files in the compilation path
- Import path conflicts
- Duplicate component definitions

## Current State:

The main App.tsx at `workstation/frontend/src/App.tsx` now serves as the single source of truth, incorporating the best features from all versions while maintaining TypeScript compatibility.
