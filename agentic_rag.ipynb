    "# Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Local Llama 2 & ChromaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**. It focuses on transcribing audio data, potentially from an Omi streaming device, storing both the transcription and audio, and then using the transcription with a local **Ai Studio** model and **ChromaDB** for intelligent question-answering. The system determines whether additional context is needed before generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Audio Transcription Workflow** for processing data from devices like Omi.\n",
    "- **Storage of Audio and Transcriptions** for AI processing.\n",
    "- **Llama 2 Model** for high-quality text generation.\n",
    "- **ChromaDB Vector Store** for efficient semantic search on transcriptions.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Context Retrieval** to improve answer accuracy.\n",
    "- **Two Answering Modes**:\n",
    "  - With RAG (Retrieves relevant document content before responding).\n",
    "  - Without RAG (Directly generates responses)."
